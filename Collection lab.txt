Create an Order class which contains

	Symbol
        
        Price

	Quantity

	Side (enum -> Buy, Sell) 

	Status (enum -> Placed, PartiallyFilled, Filled, Cancelled)

	DateTime
 
Make the Order class naturally ordered by its DateTime by implementing Comparable<Order>
 
Create a Trade class which contains:

	Symbol	

	Quantity

	Price

	DateTime
 
Make the Trade class have VALUE equality by implementing hashCode and equals

Make the Trade class naturally ordered by its DateTime by implementing Comparable<Trade>
 
Implement a simple menu

	It must be able to switch user (can just be a string)

	It should let the user enter details for a new order		

	When the order details are entered create an instance of Order

		Set the DateTime in the constructor equal to right now

		Set the Status in the constructor equal to Placed
ask user if want to buy or sell??
implement side??


Use a HashMap which maps the user to a Sorted List of Orders

	When the user creates a new order

		Add the order to the List of Orders in the HashMap for the User

		Check in each of the OTHER users List of Orders in reverse (oldest first)

			If the Symbols of the order match AND

			If the side, buy/sell, are opposite AND

			If the other order does not have the Status Filled or Cancelled AND

			If the Buy order has a price HIGHER than the Sell order

				Create a Trade object using the order details

				If the quantity being sold is LESS than bought

					Set the Status in the Sell order to Filled

					Reduce the Quantity in the Sell order to 0

					Set the Status in the Buy order to PartiallyFilled

					Reduce the Quantity in the Buy order by the amount of the original Sell order

				If the quantity being sold is MORE than bought

					Set the Status in the Sell order to PartiallyFilled

					Reduce the Quantity in the Sell order by the amount in the Buy order

					Set the Status in the Buy order to Filled

					Reduce the Quantity in the Buy order to 0

				The Trade object should capture the Buy price (even if it's higher than Sell)

				The Trade object should capture the Quantity actually traded

				The DateTime should be set in the Trade constructor to right now

				Add the Trade object into a Sorted Set


Extend your menu

	Implement the functionality to calculate the total value of all trades

	Implement the functionality to calculate the total value of all trades in the last 10 minutes

	Implement the functionality to display the total quantities of Orders based on their Symbol and Side
