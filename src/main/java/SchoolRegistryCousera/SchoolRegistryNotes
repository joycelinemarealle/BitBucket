I build a Graphical User Interface of a school registry for students and teachers using object oriented programming. I accomplished this by completing each task in the project:

Setting up Java environment.

Encapsulation.

Inheritance.

Polymorphism.

Abstraction.

Creating a customized Graphical User Interface.

Creating a panel for user input.

Integration of the components with the code.
